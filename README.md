            Hi, I'm Anshul. I'm a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OYy_UtINo4" target = "_blank">Forward Deployed Software Engineer</a> at <a href = "https://www.palantir.com/">Palantir Technologies</a> in 
           <a href = "https://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_hd" target = "_blank"> New York City</a>. I'm a recent graduate 
            of the University of Pennsylvania, where I recieved a
            Bachelor's Degree in CS and Philosophy, a Minor in Mathematics and a Master's Degree in Data Science. 
            At Penn, I was involved with ML research, taught CS &amp; Math,  and worked on interesting projects. 
            Previously, I've been a Software Engineer at <a href = "https://home.barclays/" target="_blank">Barclays</a> and 
            <a href = "https://www.upenn.edu/" target = "_blank"> Penn</a>. 
          </p>
          <p style={{'paddingBottom' : '20px'}}>
            Outside work, I enjoy playing table tennis, longboarding, travelling through the US, working on Arduiono,Rasberry Pi &amp; IOT projects,
            and documenting rare rock and mineral collections - a childhood hobby I revived
            upon visiting <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dJX32lxVtI" target="_blank">AMNH's
            Rocks &amp; Minerals Collection</a> (Next stop - <a href = "https://www.si.edu/spotlight/geogallery" target="_blank">DC</a>).
