Hi, I'm Anshul. I'm a senior undergrad + grad student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm working towards a Bachelor's in CS and Philosophy, a minor in Mathematics and a Master's in Data Science.

At Penn, I've been involved with ML research, taught CS & Math, and worked on interesting software. Previously, I have worked at Barclays and Penn as a Software Engineer. I will graduate from Penn this December.

Outside school, I spent this summer longboarding around Philly, learning new pasta recipes, and documenting rare rock and mineral collections - a childhood hobby I revived upon visiting <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dJX32lxVtI">AMNH's Rocks & Minerals Collection</a> (Next stop - <a href = "https://www.si.edu/spotlight/geogallery">DC</a>).
