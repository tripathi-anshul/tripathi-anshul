Hi, I'm Anshul. I'm a final semester undergrad + grad student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm
            finishing up a Bachelor's in CS and Philosophy, a minor in Mathematics and a Master's in Data Science. 

At Penn, 
I've been involved with ML research, taught CS &amp; Math,  and worked on interesting projects.  
Previously, I've done Software Engineering at <a href = "https://home.barclays/" target="_blank">Barclays</a> and 
<a href = "https://www.upenn.edu/" target = "_blank"> Penn</a>. 
After graduating this December, I'll be working at <a href = "https://www.palantir.com/" target = "_blank">Palantir</a> as 
a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OYy_UtINo4" target = "_blank">Forward Deployed Engineer</a>  in 
<a href = "https://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_hd" target = "_blank"> New York City</a> starting April 2022.

Outside school, I spent this summer longboarding around Philly, learning new pasta 
recipes, and documenting rare rock and mineral collections - a childhood hobby I revived
upon visiting <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dJX32lxVtI" target="_blank">AMNH's
Rocks &amp; Minerals Collection</a> (Next stop - <a href = "https://www.si.edu/spotlight/geogallery" target="_blank">DC</a>).
I'm currently planning a long trip through the US some time between January and March next year.
